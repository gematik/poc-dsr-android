Device Security Rating (DSR) is a Proof of Concept to demonstrate the secure access to services using Zero Trust design principles. In contrast to enterprise-centric Zero Trust architectures, where devices need to be owned and/or managed by a company, the DSR PoC is designed in a way that allows participants from different legal and organisational entities without the need of giving up the ownership of their devices.

This repository contains a proof of concept implementation of an Android client. The whole system architecture and other implementations of the PoC can be found at [https://dsr.gematik.solutions](https://dsr.gematik.solutions).
